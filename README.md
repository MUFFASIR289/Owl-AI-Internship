## 📊 Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A practical exercise in data cleaning, visualization, and pattern identification using a public dataset.

* **Dataset Used:** Titanic Survival Dataset (Kaggle).
* **Objective:** Identify key data patterns and relationships that influence survival.
* **Key Findings:**
    * Strong influence of **`Sex`** (Women and children first).
    * Significant correlation between **`Pclass`** (Socio-economic status) and survival rate.
    * Data cleaning included imputation of `Age` and `Embarked`.
* **Deliverables:**
    * **`task-3-eda-titanic/EDA_Titanic_Notebook.ipynb`** (Full code and visualizations)
    * **`task-3-eda-titanic/EDA_Report_Summary.md`** (Concise summary report)

## 📈 Hard Task 4: Machine Learning Model Comparison

The final task focused on practical model building, evaluation, and comparison.

* **Objective:** Build and compare two distinct machine learning models on the same dataset.
* **Models Compared:**
    1.  **Linear Regression** (As a baseline/simple model)
    2.  **Random Forest Classifier** (For robust non-linear classification)
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
* **Key Steps:** Data preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, and metric calculation.
* **Deliverables:**
    * **`task-4-model-comparison/ML_Model_Comparison_Notebook.ipynb`** (Full code, training, and evaluation)
    * **`task-4-model-comparison/Model_Comparison_Report.pdf`** (Formal report comparing performance)
